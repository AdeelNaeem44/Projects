      "yeah visual \n",

      "like you know mapping arbitrary \n",

      "and what you're predicting \n",
      "doesn't so much matter yeah it seems \n",
      "like you can generalize that quite well \n",
      "so obviously language models predict the \n",

      "any uh action or any token uh and it's \n",

      "help us get closer and closer sort of \n",
      "creating benchmarks that test the \n",
      "journalizability and it's just still \n",
      "interesting that this fella alan turing \n",

      "maybe philosophically but was trying to \n",
      "formulate a benchmark that could be \n",
      "followed it is \n",
      "even though it's it's fuzzy it's still \n",
      "sufficiently rigorous to where you can \n",
      "run that test and i still think \n",
      "something like the touring test will at \n",
      "the end of the day \n",
      "be the thing that truly \n",

      "uh play games with you use language \n",

      "um my parents didn't really know \n",
      "anything about computers so but because \n",
      "it was my money from a chess competition \n",
      "i could i could say i i wanted to buy it \n",
      "uh and then you know i just went to \n",
      "bookstores got books on programming and \n",
      "um started typing in you know the \n",
      "programming code and and then of course \n",
      "um once you start doing that you start \n",
      "adjusting it and then making your own \n",
      "games and that's when i fell in love \n",
      "with computers and realized that they \n",
      "were a very magical device um in a way i \n",
      "kind of i would have been able to \n",
      "explain this at the time but i felt that \n",
      "they were sort of almost a magical \n",
      "extension of your mind i always had this \n",

      "that was first \n",
      "started \n",

      "showing off so yeah well lots of my \n",
      "friends had atari st's and i i managed \n",
      "to get amigas it was a bit more powerful \n",

      "just stick on chess briefly uh on the \n",
      "human side of chess you've proposed that \n",
      "from a game design perspective the thing \n",
      "that makes chess \n",
      "compelling as a game \n",
      "uh is that there's a creative tension \n",
      "between a bishop \n",
      "and the knight \n",
      "can you explain this first of all it's \n",
      "really interesting to think about what \n",
      "makes the game compelling \n",
      "makes it stick across centuries \n",
      "yeah i was sort of thinking about this \n",

      "players don't think about it necessarily \n",
      "from a games designer point of view so \n",
      "it's with my game design hat on that i \n",
      "was thinking about this why is chess so \n",
      "compelling \n",
      "and i think a critical uh reason is the \n",
      "the dynamicness of of of the different \n",
      "kind of chess positions you can have \n",
      "whether they're closed or open and other \n",
      "things comes from the bishop and the \n",
      "night so if you think about how \n",
      "different the the the capabilities of \n",
      "the bishop and knight are in terms of \n",
      "the way they move and then somehow chess \n",
      "has evolved to balance those two \n",
      "capabilities more or less equally so \n",
      "they're both roughly worth three points \n",
      "each so you think that dynamics was \n",
      "always there and then the rest of the \n",
      "rules are kind of trying to stabilize \n",
      "the game well maybe i mean it's sort of \n",
      "i don't know his chicken and egg \n",
      "situation probably both came together \n",
      "but the fact that it's got to this \n",
      "beautiful equilibrium where you can have \n",
      "the bishop and knight they're so \n",
      "different in power um but so equal in \n",
      "value across the set of the universe of \n",
      "all positions right somehow they've been \n",
      "balanced by humanity over hundreds of \n",
      "years um i think gives gives the game \n",
      "the creative tension uh that you can \n",
      "swap the bishop and knights uh for a \n",
      "bishop for a knight and you you they're \n",
      "more or less worth the same but now you \n",
      "aim for a different type of position if \n",
      "you have the knight you want a closed \n",
      "position if you have the bishop you want \n",
      "an open position so i think that creates \n",
      "a lot of the creative tension in chess \n",
      "so some kind of controlled creative \n",
      "tension \n",
      "from an ai perspective \n",
      "do you think ai systems convention \n",
      "design games that are optimally \n",
      "compelling to humans \n",
      "well that's an interesting question you \n",
      "know sometimes i get asked about \n",
      "ai and creativity and and this and the \n",
      "way i answered that is relevant to that \n",
      "question which is that i think they're \n",
      "different levels of creativity one could \n",
      "say so i think um if we define \n",
      "creativity as coming up with something \n",
      "original right that's that's useful for \n",
      "a purpose then you know i think the kind \n",
      "of lowest level of creativity is like an \n",
      "interpolation so an averaging of all the \n",
      "examples you see so maybe a very basic \n",
      "ai system could say you could have that \n",
      "so you show it millions of pictures of \n",
      "cats and then you say give me an average \n",
      "looking cat right generate me an average \n",
      "looking cat i would call that \n",
      "interpolation then there's extrapolation \n",
      "which something like alphago showed so \n",
      "alphago played you know millions of \n",
      "games of go against itself \n",
      "and then it came up with brilliant new \n",
      "ideas like move 37 in game two bringing \n",
      "a motif strategies and go that that no \n",
      "humans had ever thought of even though \n",
      "we've played it for thousands of years \n",
      "and professionally for hundreds of years \n",
      "so that that i call that extrapolation \n",
      "but then that's still there's still a \n",
      "level above that which is you know you \n",
      "could call out the box thinking or true \n",
      "innovation which is could you invent go \n",
      "right could you invent chess and not \n",
      "just come up with a brilliant chess move \n",

      "actually invent chess or something as \n",
      "good as chess or go and i think one day \n",
      "uh ai could but what's missing is how \n",
      "would you even specify that task to a a \n",

      "it if i was best telling a human to do \n",
      "it or a games designer a human games \n",

      "that way because you know in the \n",
      "beginning \n",
      "i mean that's a great invention just the \n",
      "protein itself yes i mean and then they \n",
      "there's i think probably a history of \n",

      "magical and incredible uh uh uh as i \n",
      "said little little bio-nano machines and \n",

      "just get to world champion performance \n",

      "we had in there the system including \n",
      "things like symmetry of the go board uh \n",
      "were removed so the alpha zero could \n",

      "everyone thought that was impossible or \n",
      "at least a decade away um from when we \n",
      "when we did it back in 2015 24 you know \n",
      "2016 and um \n",
      "and so yes it would have been \n",

      "representations maybe that the brain \n",
      "uses so as at a systems level not at a \n",
      "implementation level um and then the \n",
      "other big things were compute and gpus \n",

      "a place where it became commoditized \n",
      "mostly through the games industry and \n",
